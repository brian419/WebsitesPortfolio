## Personal notes to run git:

- git branch, make sure I am on the right website branch when I am working on a particular website. 
- git checkout [website-one, website-two, website-three, main]
- git add . / git commit -m "message" / git push origin [website-one, website-two, website-three]
- git merge [website-one, website-two, website-three] -m "merge message"
- git push origin main (pushes the final merging to main to github)
